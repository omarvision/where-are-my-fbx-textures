# where-are-my-fbx-textures
I went to mixamo.com and downloaded one of their character models with some animations to use in Unity. The fbx model did not have it's textures? The model was all white? Why? In this video I go over how to fix that. It's something you have to do on the Unity side. Select the fbx model and then in the inspector window press the materials button and Extract Textures first, then Extract materials second if you have to.  The textures are inside the FBX but Unity can't see them from in there until you extract them in the Inspector window.
